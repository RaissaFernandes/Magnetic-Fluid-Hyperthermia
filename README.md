# Magnetic-Fluid-Hyperthermia

This repository contains an agent-based simulation model developed to investigate thermal energy diffusion in tissues subjected to Magnetic Fluid Hyperthermia (MFH) treatment for cancer, specifically glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). The model was developed as part of a master's thesis in the field of Physics.



## **Context**

MFH is a therapy in which superparamagnetic nanoparticles are administered to the tumor and heated using an alternating magnetic field. The technique leverages the higher temperature sensitivity of neoplastic cells compared to healthy cells, aiming to induce necrosis in the neoplastic tissue without damaging the surrounding healthy tissue.


## **Model Objective**

The objective of this simulation model is to enable the investigation and study of thermal energy diffusion in tissues subjected to MFH. It was developed as a complementary tool to existing experimental research and numerical modeling methods. The model is agent-based and allows for simulating the behavior of nanoparticles, the applied magnetic field, and thermal energy propagation in the tissue.

## **Main File**

The main files for this model are available in two formats: NLogo and HTML. The NLogo file can be opened and run using the NetLogo software. The HTML file allows you to run the simulation directly in your web browser, without the need to install NetLogo. 
Choose the format that best suits your needs to explore and interact with the model.
The files not only contain the model code but also its documentation.




## **How to Run**

To run the model, you have two options depending on your preference:

### **Option 1: NetLogo**

Ensure that you have NetLogo installed on your computer.
Open the model.nlogo file using NetLogo.
In the NetLogo environment, you can interact with the model, adjust parameters as needed, and run simulations.

### **Option 2: NetLogo Web**

Open the model.html file in your web browser.
Interact with the simulation directly in your browser window. You can interact with the model, adjust parameters as needed, and run simulations.
Please note that running the model with the HTML file has some limitations when it comes to data extraction. However, it provides the advantage of being able to run the model online without the need to download NetLogo.
